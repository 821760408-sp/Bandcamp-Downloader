# Bandcamp-Downloader
Download albums from Bandcamp.com using Node.JS

#Howto
* Navigate to the directory
```
npm install
```
```
node app.js bandcamp_url
```
#How are my files saved?
In your working directory -> Artist -> Album -> Artist - Track.mp3

#Important Notice!
Buy the tracks/albums you like. This is a learning exercise and stepping stone to another app I am building to better experience the bandcamp website despite the removal of their API system.
